# Mint Home - Take Home Challenge

Welcome to the Mint Home take home challenge! This repo contains two coding challenges that will help us evaluate your technical skills and problem-solving approach.

## Overview

At Mint Home, we’re revolutionizing HVAC replacements by empowering homeowners to:

- Get instant, AI-driven quotes, no in-home sales visits, all generated online in minutes 
- Compare transparent pricing options, including rebates and flexible financing

We use software to simplify a traditionally complex, sales-heavy process, cutting out hassle and hidden fees while ensuring quality HVAC installations.

This take home challenge have been crafted to mirror real-world scenarios of our platform. It will assess your ability to build solutions using our stack and tackle scenarios similar to what our engineers face on a daily basis.

## Challenges

### 1. Concurrent Fibonacci (TypeScript)

**Location:** [01-concurrent-fibonacci](./01-concurrent-fibonacci)

Implement a concurrent memoized Fibonacci function in TypeScript. This challenge tests your understanding of:
- Algorithms
- Asynchronous programming
- Memoization techniques
- Handling concurrent operations efficiently


### 2. Multi-Step Wizard Application (Next.js & NestJS)

**Location:** [02-wizard-application](./02-wizard-application)

Create a simple full-stack application that simulates a multi-step quote request wizard for HVAC installation services. This challenge tests your ability to:
- Build a multi-step form with simple conditional logic
- Implement a RESTful API
- Work with a databases

## Submission Guidelines

1. For your submission, create a new public repository or provide a ZIP file with your complete solution, so we can run it locally.
2. Include clear documentation on how to run the solutions to both challenges.

Good luck! We look forward to reviewing your solutions.
